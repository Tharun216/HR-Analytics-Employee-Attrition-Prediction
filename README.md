# Project Motivation
Employee attrition significantly impacts organizations, resulting in increased recruitment costs, operational disruptions, and loss of expertise. Leveraging HR analytics and machine learning, this project seeks to enable proactive retention strategies by predicting attrition risks within an organization.

# Objectives
1. Develop an accurate machine learning model to predict employee attrition.
2. Identify and analyze key factors contributing to attrition.
3. Address data imbalances and provide interpretable insights.
4. Recommend actionable retention strategies based on model findings.
   
# Dataset
1. Source: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing 1,400+ records with 30 features.
2. Key Features: Age, job role, department, salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.
3. Preprocessing Steps: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and balancing class distribution.
   
# Methodology
1. Data Preparation: Data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling imbalances.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying relationships between variables like salary and attrition.
3. Model Development: Tested algorithms include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
4. Evaluation: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   
# Technologies Used
1. Python for data processing and machine learning.
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
3. Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI (for visualization).

# Results
The ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, yielded the highest predictive accuracy. Important attrition factors identified include job satisfaction, salary, and tenure.

# Future Work
1. Experiment with more complex models like neural networks.
2. Explore real-time attrition prediction with live HR data.
3. Integrate an interactive dashboard for ongoing monitoring of attrition rates and predictions.
